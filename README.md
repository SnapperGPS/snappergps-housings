# snappergps-housings

This repository contains different housing designs intended to provide some protection for [a SnapperGPS PCB](https://github.com/SnapperGPS/snappergps-pcb/), a battery, and an antenna during testing.

All designs are designed to be 3D-printed.
If you want to use any of these designs for a long-term deployment, we advice you to carfully consider whether the material is suitable for the deployemnt environment.
It might be possible to make the housings more suitable by applying a finsih to the outer surface.
Other housing options for packaging a SnapperGPS PCB for a deployment, which are not part of this repository, include:
* Heat shrink tubing (light-weight and waterproof),
* Vacuum packing (light-weight and waterproof),
* CNC milling (sturdy and waterproof with screws and O-ring).

## Printing instructions

We printed all housings with ABS+. However, it should be possible to use another material, e.g., PLA, but it might be necessary to adjust the inner dimensions of the housing designs a little to account for different shrinking properties of the material.
We printed the housings with 20% and 40% infill ratio, but you can select a lower ratio for a lighter print or a higher ratio for increased robustness.

# Tray

The tray holds a SnapperGPS PCB, a flat battery, and an *APAM1368YB13V3.0* active GNSS antenna in place.

# Thin box

The box holds a SnapperGPS PCB, a battery, and an active GNSS antenna, e.g., an *Echo 27* or an *APAM1368YB13V3.0*, in place and can be closed with a lid.

# Thick box

![Thick box](images/snappergps-thick-box.png)

The same as the [thin box](thin-box), but with twice the wall thickness.

# Box with cut-outs

![Box with cut-outs](images/snappergps-box-with-cut-outs.png)

The same as the [thin box](thin-box), but with two cut-outs to attach a USB cable and to monitor the status LED without opening the box.
